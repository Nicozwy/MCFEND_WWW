        <h2 id="abstract">1. Abstract</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of fake news across various online sources has had a significant influence on the public. Existing Chinese fake news detection datasets are limited to news sourced solely from Weibo. However, fake news originating from multiple sources exhibits diversity in various aspects, including its content and social context. Methods trained on purely one single news source can hardly be applicable to real-world scenarios. Our pilot experiment demonstrates that the F1 score of the state-of-the-art method that learns from a large Chinese fake news detection dataset, Weibo-21, drops significantly from 0.943 to 0.470 when the test data is changed to multi-source news data, failing to identify more than one-third of the multi-source fake news. To address this limitation, we constructed the first multi-source benchmark dataset for Chinese fake news detection, termed MCFEND, which is composed of news we collected from diverse sources such as social platforms, messaging apps, and traditional online news outlets. Notably, such news has been fact-checked by 14 authoritative fact-checking agencies worldwide. In addition, various existing Chinese fake news detection methods are thoroughly evaluated on our proposed dataset in cross-source, multi-source, and unseen source ways. MCFEND, as a benchmark dataset, aims to advance Chinese fake news detection approaches in real-world scenarios.</p>
